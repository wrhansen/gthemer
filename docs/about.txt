What Does This Application Do?
------------------------------

	This application allows you to create a custom color
	scheme for applications that use GtkSourceView (gedit).
	This application allows for you to create color schemes
	through	use of a simple graphical user interface that
	allows for you to select individual languages or styles
	and customize as you wish.
	
	GThemer saves your custom theme to the format that
	GtkSourceView expects (xml). With this theme file 
	you can	then add it to the theme manager in your
	favorite GtkSourceView application for use in that
	application!
