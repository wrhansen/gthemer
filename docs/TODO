This document lists all the things I have yet to do or intend to do for 
the gthemer project:

4) Package it up
	a) Release source on github
	b) Figure out how to package it for aptitude
		I) Goal is to release it for Ubuntu Software Center
		
		


GUI
	- TreeView with editable cells
		- Color chooser
		- Pixbuf check marks for the bool cells
		- Changing a cell gives that row the formatting

	- Open existing xml file.
		- Correctly populate the treeview
			- Which means the sourceview_styles object should
			  be able to be created from an xml file.
